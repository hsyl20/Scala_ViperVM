\chapter{Advanced Runtime Systems}

Kernels cannot allocate buffers nor views. Applications have to allocate
them as appropriate before executing kernels. This could be left to the runtime
to perform.

We can associate a function to each kernel that would take the same parameters
as the kernel and allocate required buffers and (meta-)views.
