\chapter{Algorithm choices}

We provide a way to autotune codes Ã -la PetaBricks.
Many functions can be associated to a single one.

For instance, suppose we have a function Double2DMatrixMultiplication.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Native kernels
  \item Basic algorithm
  \item Recursive decomposition algorithm
  \item Strassen's algorithm
  \item Iteration-order (blocking)
  \item Transpose
\end{itemize}
There may be constraints on parameters (maximum size, etc.)
