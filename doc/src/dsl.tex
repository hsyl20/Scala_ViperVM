\chapter{Domain Specific Languages}

Domain specific languages allow domain experts to express their needs with their domain conventions.

We provide some basic DSL for common domains.
These could be further extended easily.

\section{Linear Algebra}

\begin{lstlisting}
val m = Matrix.filled(0.0, 100, 300)
val n = Matrix.loadFromFile("matrix.dat")

val c = m * n
c.saveToFile("result.dat")
\end{lstlisting}

This code involves two tasks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item FillMatrix(0.0, 100, 300)
  \item MatrixProduct(m,n)
\end{itemize}
and one action:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MatrixSaveToFile(c, "result.dat")
\end{itemize}


Now, if we have the following kind of code:
\begin{lstlisting}
val u = m(10, 15)
println(u)
\end{lstlisting}

To determine u, m needs to be computed.
